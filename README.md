Project Scope

Autograder for Object-Oriented Programming Assignments (JAVA only). The project focuses on designing, developing an automated judging/grading system that can be utilized to grade and mark assignments from Object Oriented Programming.
The system must:
- Accept a ZIP file containing one or more .java files.
- Evaluate the correctness of the code based on predefined test cases from the assignment specification.
- Produce a PDF report with the results of test cases (pass/fail) and provide feedback where necessary.
- Calculate and present an overall score for the submission based on the test results.
